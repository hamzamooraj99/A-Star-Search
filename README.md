# A* Search in Python
There are three files: **hwu_search.py**, **search.py** and **grid.py**

## hwu_search.py
This is a base file that contains classes with empty functions, and the main working of the search algorithm.

## search.py
This file imports **hwu_search.py** and completes the empty functions in the classes. This allows the search algorithm written in the **hwu_search.py** file to be executd using an A* Method.
This file also defines a class that outlines how the computer views an variable grid world.

## grid.py
This file outlines the grids in the form of numpy arrays, and implements the search algorithm on the grids. There are two grids created already in the file.
